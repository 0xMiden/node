# Genesis configuration example with AggLayer account files
#
# This example demonstrates how to include pre-built accounts from .mac files
# in the genesis block. The account files are generated by the build script
# using deterministic seeds for reproducibility.
#
# They demonstrate interdependencies between accounts:
# - bridge.mac: AggLayer bridge account for cross-chain asset transfers
# - agglayer_faucet_eth.mac: AggLayer faucet for wrapped ETH, depends on the bridge account.
# - agglayer_faucet_usdc.mac: AggLayer faucet for wrapped USDC, depends on the bridge account.
#
# Paths are relative to the directory containing this configuration file.
